ðŸš€ Day 15 of the 90 Days of Coding Challenge! ðŸš€

Today, I continued to dive deeper into C programming, focusing on building a simple phone book project. ðŸ’»âœ¨

ðŸŒŸ **Highlights of the Day:**
1. Implemented basic functionalities like adding contacts and searching for them by name.
2. Explored concepts of structures, linked lists, and dynamic memory allocation in C.
3. Started developing a menu-driven interface to interact with the phone book.

ðŸ’¡ Each step forward in my C programming journey brings me closer to mastering this powerful language! ðŸ’ªðŸ“ž

ðŸ‘‰ Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to refine my phone book project and delve into more advanced topics in C programming! Let's keep the coding momentum going strong! ðŸ”¥
