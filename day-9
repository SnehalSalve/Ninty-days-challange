🚀 Day 9 of the 90 Days Coding Challenge! 🌟

Today, I delved deeper into JavaScript, mastering the `prompt` and `alert` functions, and explored the magic of `setTimeout` for creating dynamic web experiences! 💻✨

🌟 **Highlights of the Day:**
1. Nailed down the usage of `prompt` and `alert` to engage users interactively in my projects.
2. Experimented with `setTimeout` to add delays and enhance user experience in my web applications.
3. Crushed some tough problems on HackerRank, honing my problem-solving skills for real-world scenarios.

📁 **GitHub Update:** Successfully pushed all my code and project data to GitHub, ensuring seamless collaboration and version control throughout my coding journey.

💡 Each day's progress fuels my determination to conquer coding challenges and reach new heights! 💪🔥

👉 Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to level up my coding skills and explore the vast world of programming!
