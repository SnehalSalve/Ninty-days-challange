ðŸš€ Day 22 of the 90 Days of Coding Challenge! ðŸš€

Today, I delved into the fascinating world of preprocessor directives in C, exploring their role in code optimization and organization. Additionally, I had a blast implementing the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in C, honing my problem-solving skills along the way. ðŸ’»ðŸŽ®

ðŸŒŸ **Highlights of the Day:**
1. Explored the fundamentals of preprocessor directives and their impact on code compilation.
2. Implemented the Stone-Paper-Scissors game in C, adding a fun twist to my coding journey.
3. Reviewed theoretical concepts to solidify my understanding and prepare for future challenges.

ðŸ’¡ Each day brings new discoveries and opportunities for growth, and I'm excited to continue pushing the boundaries of my coding skills! ðŸ’ª

ðŸ‘‰ Stay tuned for more updates as I embark on further coding adventures! Let's keep the momentum going strong! ðŸ”¥
