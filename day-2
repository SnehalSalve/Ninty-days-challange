🚀 Day 2 of the 90 Days Coding Challenge! 🚀

Another day, another step forward in my coding journey! 🎉 Today, on Day 2, I continued to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building on what I learned yesterday. 💻

🌟 **Today's Achievements:**
1. Learned more about HTML tags and how to structure a webpage.
2. Explored CSS styling basics like colors, fonts, and borders.
3. Started experimenting with simple JavaScript functions like alerts and prompts.

💡 Each small victory feels like a win, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me! 💪

👉 Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to learn and grow with each passing day! Let's keep the coding momentum going strong! 🔥
