ðŸš€ Day 18 of the 90 Days Coding Challenge! ðŸš€

Today was all about enhancing my problem-solving skills in C programming! ðŸ’¡ Here's a glimpse of what I accomplished:

ðŸŒŸ **Highlights of the Day:**
1. Implemented functions to find the maximum and minimum elements in an array.
2. Developed a function to find the last occurrence of a specific character in a string.
3. Successfully identified and counted vowels in a given string.
4. Created a user-defined function to find a specific character in a string and return its index.

ðŸ’» Each problem solved brings me closer to mastering the intricacies of C programming! ðŸ’ª

ðŸ‘‰ Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore and conquer new challenges on this coding journey! ðŸ”¥
