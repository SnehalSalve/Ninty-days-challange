ðŸš€ Day 16 of the 90 Days of Coding Challenge! ðŸš€

Today, I delved into dynamic memory allocation in C, exploring the concepts of malloc, calloc, and realloc. ðŸ’»âœ¨

ðŸŒŸ **Highlights of the Day:**
1. Mastered the use of malloc to dynamically allocate memory for variables and arrays.
2. Explored the calloc function for allocating memory and initializing it with zero values.
3. Learned how to use realloc to resize dynamically allocated memory blocks as needed.

In addition, I also developed a simple quiz game with limited questions and answers, adding an interactive element to my learning journey! ðŸŽ®

ðŸ’¡ Each new concept I grasp brings me closer to becoming a proficient programmer! ðŸ’ªðŸ§ 

ðŸ‘‰ Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore the fascinating world of coding. Let's keep the momentum going strong! ðŸ”¥
