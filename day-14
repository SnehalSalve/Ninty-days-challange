🚀 Day 14 of the 90 Days of Coding Challenge! 🚀

Today was an exciting day as I built a Tic Tac Toe game in C! 💻 This project allowed me to apply my knowledge of loops, arrays, and conditional statements, enhancing my problem-solving skills. Additionally, I took some time to revise the old chapters, reinforcing my understanding of fundamental concepts.

🌟 **Highlights of the Day:**
1. Completed the implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game, adding functionality for player input, game board display, and win condition checks.
2. Refactored and optimized the codebase to improve readability and performance.
3. Reviewed previous chapters, solidifying my understanding of key programming concepts.

💡 Each project I undertake and every concept I revisit brings me closer to mastery in C programming! 💪🔍

👉 Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore new projects and deepen my understanding of programming fundamentals. Let's keep the coding momentum going strong! 🔥
