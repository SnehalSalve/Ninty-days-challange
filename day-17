ðŸš€ Day 17 of the 90 Days of Coding Challenge! ðŸš€

Today, I delved into the fascinating world of strings in C, exploring a variety of string-related operations including static and dynamic string handling, searching for occurrences, and manipulating cases. ðŸ’»âœ¨

ðŸŒŸ **Highlights of the Day:**
1. Explored static string handling techniques, mastering operations like string concatenation and comparison.
2. Dived into dynamic string manipulation, understanding the use of dynamic memory allocation for strings.
3. Learned how to search for occurrences of a substring within a string, enhancing my string processing skills.
4. Explored methods to convert strings to uppercase and lowercase, adding versatility to my string handling capabilities.

With each new concept I grasp, I'm one step closer to becoming a proficient C programmer! ðŸ’ªðŸ§ 

ðŸ‘‰ Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to unravel the mysteries of programming. Let's keep the coding momentum going strong! ðŸ”¥
